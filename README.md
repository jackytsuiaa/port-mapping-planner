# Port-Mapping-Planner

This is a port mapping planner powered by Ansible.

It is mainly used for providing interface details of the legacy Cisco devices in over 1000 retail stores in order to migrate to Juniper Networks.

This project basically includes 2 functions
* play1 - Crawling from a seed switch in each store to get a full switch inventory 
* play2 - Get interface details with new vlan convertion from Cisco to Juniper
